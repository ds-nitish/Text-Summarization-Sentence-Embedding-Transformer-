## Introduction
Text summarization is a technique used to condense large amounts of text into shorter versions while preserving the key information and main ideas. It is a crucial task in natural language processing and has applications in various domains such as news summarization, document summarization, and content extraction. On the other hand, sentence embedding refers to the process of representing sentences as fixed-length numerical vectors that capture their semantic meaning. Sentence embeddings are valuable for tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and similarity analysis.

In this Jupyter Notebook, we focus on leveraging BERT, a state-of-the-art language model, for text summarization and sentence embedding. BERT is a Transformer-based model that has been pre-trained on vast amounts of textual data and has shown remarkable performance on various natural language processing tasks. By fine-tuning BERT, we can adapt it to specific tasks such as text summarization and sentence embedding.

## Installation
To run the notebook locally, follow these installation steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system (preferably Python 3.6 or later).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Install the required Python dependencies by running the following command in your terminal
   

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the cloned repository and open the `text_summarization_and_sentence_embedding.ipynb` notebook.
3. The notebook provides detailed explanations and code examples for text summarization and sentence embedding tasks using BERT. Follow the instructions and comments in each code cell to understand the implementation steps.
4. Run the code cells by clicking the "Run" button or using the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter. Make sure to run the cells in order, as some cells may depend on variables or functions defined in previous cells.
5. The notebook includes sections for both text summarization and sentence embedding. Each section provides relevant code snippets, explanations, and examples to guide you through the process.
6. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different parameters to see how it affects the results. You can also apply the techniques to your own text data for further exploration.

## Examples
The notebook covers several practical examples to demonstrate the capabilities of BERT for text summarization and sentence embedding. These examples include:
- Extractive text summarization using BERT and the TextRank algorithm
- Abstractive text summarization with BERT-based models
- Generating sentence embeddings using BERT
- Fine-tuning BERT for sentence classification

Each example includes detailed explanations, code implementations, and sample outputs to help you understand and apply the techniques effectively.
